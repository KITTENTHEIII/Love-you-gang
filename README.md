# How to use

## Method 1 (pre-compiled .EXE)  [Recommended]

Download the EXE folder, and run the executable file inside.

## Method 2 (manually compiling)

Install the Rust programming language stuff, download "lyg" and then open a terminal in the folder you just downloaded and run "cargo build" for compiling the script and then search for the .EXE (lyg\target\debug)
